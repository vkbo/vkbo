The website has a [contact form](https://berglyd.net/contact-me/).
You can also find me on Twitter as [@IamVKBO](https://twitter.com/IamVKBO/).
I keep some general documents and files in the main account repo.
For an overview, see the [index](https://github.com/vkbo/vkbo/blob/main/index.md) page.
I have a few GitHub Gists posted as well, which you can find on my [gists](https://gist.github.com/vkbo) page.
