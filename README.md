### Welcome to My GitHub Page

I work as a Software Developer with [TurtleSec :turtle:](https://turtlesec.no/), and have a background in Computational Physics and Accelerator Physics.

My website is available at [berglyd.net](https://berglyd.net/).
You can also find me on Mastodon as <a href="https://mastodon.online/@veronica" rel="me">@veronica</a>.
I keep some general documents and files in the main account repo.
For an overview, see the [index](https://github.com/vkbo/vkbo/blob/main/index.md) page.
I have a few GitHub Gists posted as well, which you can find on my [gists](https://gist.github.com/vkbo) page.
