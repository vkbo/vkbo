### Welcome to My GitHub Page

I work as a Software Developer with :turtle: [TurtleSec](https://turtlesec.no/), and have a background in :atom_symbol: Computational Physics and :zap: Accelerator Physics.

My website is available at :house: [berglyd.net](https://berglyd.net/).
The website has a :mailbox: [contact form](https://berglyd.net/contact-me/).
You can also find me on :bird: Twitter as [@IamVKBO](https://twitter.com/IamVKBO/).
I keep some general documents and files in the main account repo.
For an overview, see the :page_with_curl: [index](https://github.com/vkbo/vkbo/blob/main/index.md) page.
I have a few GitHub Gists posted as well, which you can find on my :octocat: [gists](https://gist.github.com/vkbo) page.
