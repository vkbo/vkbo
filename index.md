## Main Projects

### novelWriter

novelWriter is a markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many
smaller plain text documents. It uses its own flavour of markdown that supports a meta data syntax
for comments, synopsis and cross-referencing between files. It's designed to be a simple text editor
which allows for easy organisation of text files and notes, built on plain text files for
robustness.
